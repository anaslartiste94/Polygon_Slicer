# Polygon_Slicer
 
### Summary

The laser used by the microwave departement of my school can be used to create waveguides by scraping a specific surface of a material. The laser gets a vectorial image as an input. The software of the laser is only capable of helping the user with simple shapes such as squares and rectangles. It gets quickly laborious and time consuming to scrap complex shapes.

### Input/Output of python tool
The python tool developped gets a vectorial image as an input and outputs a vectorial image.
Input: 
polygon vectorial image. 
The laser follows the edges of the polygon.

Output: 
polygon and lines vectorial image. 
The laser follows the egdes of the polygon and the lines in order to scrap the surface inside the polygon.
